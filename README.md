## About PHP Music

Laravel is a powerful PHP framework used for building web applications. In this project, we are creating a live podcast and music feed website using PHP, MySQL, and the Laravel framework.

## Features

- Live podcast streaming
- Music feed with latest releases
- User registration and authentication
- Search functionality for podcasts and music
- User profiles and playlists
- Commenting and rating system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/zisunal/php-music.git`
2. Install dependencies: `composer install`
3. Create a new MySQL database and update the `.env` file with the database credentials
4. Run database migrations: `php artisan migrate`
5. Generate application key: `php artisan key:generate`
6. Start the development server: `php artisan serve`

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the website at `http://localhost:8000`. From there, you can explore the live podcast streams, browse the music feed, register and login to your account, and interact with other users through comments and ratings.
